A fundamental lesson every developer should be aware of is “don’t reinvent the wheel.” Understanding how to use external libraries and packages in Android Studio is a big part of that. This is because, if you need to perform a common task, you probably don’t need to write the code yourself. Instead, you can use libraries to help get the job done more efficiently.

## **Why use libraries?**

Libraries extend the capabilities of the Android software development kit (SDK), allowing you to use code written by other developers. These open source libraries are hosted on an external server and are downloaded by the build system, Gradle, when you are building a project.

The best libraries provide entirely new functionalities and give you access to awesome functions with lesser code as a developer. Unlike copying and pasting code, libraries are entirely portable and easy to plug in too. This makes it easy to access advanced features with minimal work or confusion.

## **Types of libraries**

Below are the various categories in Android development and the common libraries used in them:

### **Image loading**

Image loading libraries come in handy to avoid high memory consumption caused by loading multiple images at the same time.

For example, Fresco is an image loading library focused on providing a smooth scrolling experience while an image is loading. Fresco ensures image loading is as swift and smooth as possible by applying smart caching to minimize storage overhead.

### **Videos**

Displaying videos is usually a daunting task for developers during development. Without the use of a library, the processes and details to take care of can be too numerous to handle.

ExoPlayer built by Google is an example of an Android media player library. It offers an alternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API to play audio and video, locally or online, with some additional advantages. One of ExoPlayer’s biggest benefits is its ease of customization.

### **Networking**

Nowadays, virtually every mobile app needs some sort of network communication to perform one function or another. Fortunately, there are incredible networking libraries available to help you optimize this process.

## Project Structure

In mobile app development, establishing a strong foundation is crucial, much like constructing a house starting with a solid foundation. The foundation of app development lies in the well-structured use of project folders. These folders serve as the backbone, holding together the various components of an Android project.

When initiating a project in Android Studio, the tool automatically generates a set of default files and folders that encompass everything essential for the app to run. The root directory, known as the sample app folder, serves as the primary directory for the entire project. Key folders within the project structure include:

1. **`.gradle` folder:** This folder is associated with the Gradle build toolkit, containing configurations and files used by Gradle to build the project. While these files can be deleted, they are automatically regenerated during project compilation.
2. **`.idea` folder:** Used by Android Studio to store project metadata, this folder contains configuration files specifying how apps should utilize the described data. Files within this folder indicate functional areas, such as `compiler.xml` and `modules.xml`.
3. **`app` folder:** This folder is central to the project, housing source code, UI design, and assets like images and fonts. Developers write code and create the app's user interface within this folder.
4. **`Gradle` folder:** This pertains to Android's build system, consisting of tools for building, testing, and running applications. The `build` folder within Gradle holds build-related data, including subfolders and files like `.gitignore` (for specifying excluded files in repositories), `build.gradle` (managing configuration options), `gradlew` (used by Android Studio's build system), `local.properties` (containing local configuration information), and `settings.gradle` (handling project and module settings).

External libraries, though not a folder, play a crucial role and are located within the `app` folder, showcasing third-party libraries integrated into the project.

Understanding this folder structure is essential for developers as it forms the basis for creating successful apps, ensuring an optimal user experience. This knowledge is akin to constructing a sound foundation before advancing further in the app development process.

## Gradle

In this video, the focus is on understanding how Android Studio compiles and runs application projects using Gradle, a build automation tool. Gradle manages Android projects through build configuration files, defining development processes, dependencies, and compilation results. It is an integral part of Android Studio and is automatically triggered when the "run" button is clicked.

Every Android project contains two build.gradle files: one for project-wide settings and another for module-specific settings, with modules representing units of functionality within the project. The code example provided in the video illustrates the structure of a default build.gradle file. The Android block specifies project information, such as the minimum OS version. The default config sub-block allows configuration settings like version number and application ID, while the dependencies block lists third-party libraries.

For developers seeking more control, the video introduces manual Gradle operations using command-line tools. Commands like "./gradlew build" are used to build a project, "./gradlew clean" to delete the contents of the build directory, and "./gradlew wrapper" to view available Gradle operations.

In summary, the video provides an introduction to Gradle, explaining its role in Android Studio, its impact on project development, and how developers can utilize it for effective app compilation and execution.

## Android Manifest

In this video, the Android manifest file takes center stage as an essential component generated by Android Studio when creating a new project. This XML file contains critical information about the application, including activities, receivers, services, and providers. The manifest file is crucial for defining necessary permissions required by the app to access protected areas of the operating system or other applications.

The video walks through different components of the manifest file, starting with the permission tag. This tag allows developers to specify specific requests, such as sending an SMS, by defining permissions within the XML file. The process involves using the "uses-permission" tag with attributes like "android:name" to request permissions.

The application tag within the manifest file is then explored, serving to specify the theme of the application, including elements like icons and labels. Within the application tag, the activity tag is used to define all activities across the application, with a focus on the default activity class, such as the main activity.

The intent filter, found within the application tag, is highlighted as a crucial element for specifying the initial point of running the application. For instance, the main activity class is identified as the entry point through the use of action and category tags within the intent filter.

While the video offers an overview of the Android manifest file, it emphasizes its role in defining essential information for the app, providing developers with insights into structuring and utilizing this critical XML file effectively.

## Resource

In Android development, nearly everything is considered a resource, forming a crucial aspect of the development process. Resources, which encompass files and static content like colors and animations, are organized within the Resource folder in Android Studio. These resources can be referenced throughout the application code, contributing to a more organized and accessible development structure.

The video delves into four key types of resources found in the Resource folder: string, color, dimension, and font. String resources allow developers to define and store text in the `res/values/strings.xml` file, facilitating easy access throughout the app. Color resources, managed in the `colors.xml` file, enable the effective use of colors across the app's user interface. Dimension resources, stored in `dimens.xml`, assist in managing size dimensions for various elements in the app. Lastly, the font resource, housed in the `font` directory, is utilized for managing font files throughout the app.

Understanding the significance of resources in Android development is emphasized. Resources in the Resource folder play a vital role in ensuring app compatibility across multiple devices and enhancing the overall user experience. Leveraging default resources becomes essential for supporting various device specifications, providing language support, and ensuring responsiveness across different screen orientations.

The video recommends using the "mipmap" folder for app development due to its advantages. Within the "mipmap" folder, there are various subfolders, such as "mipmap-anydpi-version26." This folder, like the "drawable" folder, contains different images and assets, but using "mipmap" simplifies the process of providing high-quality images with varying scales for different devices.

The concept is illustrated by considering a device like the Nexus 6, which has a high resolution. The app, when run on this device, will select image assets from the "mipmap-xxxhdpi" folder, ensuring high-quality visuals on devices with very high resolutions. The "mipmap" folders contain images of the same icons but in different sizes or densities, ensuring that the app retains image quality regardless of the device's density.

By using "mipmap," the selection of images is based on the density of the device, contributing to a consistent and high-quality visual experience across various devices. The video highlights the aim of placing image assets, such as icons, in the "mipmap" folder to ensure that they do not become blurry when the app is run on devices with higher densities.

In summary, the video provides insights into using the "mipmap" folder within the "res" folder to maintain high-quality image assets in an Android app project, offering a solution to the challenge of different device densities.

## Examination of Subfolders

This video delves into the significance of the "layout" folder, an integral component generated when creating an Android project. The layout folder serves as a crucial resource for managing the user interface (UI) of an application, housing XML files that declare and create the app's UI. XML, or extensible markup language, is used to separate the presentation of the app from its code, allowing developers to exert full control over the app's behavior.

The XML files within the layout folder facilitate the creation of different UIs for devices with varying screen sizes, promoting the development of scalable and seamless apps. For instance, different versions of the activity_main.xml file can be created to cater to diverse devices, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

The video specifically examines the activity_main.xml file, illustrating its hierarchical structure with parent and child elements. The Design tab in Android Studio provides a visual representation of the UI, allowing developers to create and modify UI elements easily. This visual representation is particularly beneficial when crafting complex UIs, such as a login page.

The video emphasizes the versatility of the design palette, which enables developers to drag and drop UI elements, such as text fields and buttons. Whether writing XML code or opting for a drag-and-drop approach, the design palette enhances the efficiency of UI creation.
