## Evaluating Interactive Design

### Evaluating Design

In this video, the focus is on understanding popular evaluation methodologies in UX and UI design, with the aim of improving the Little Lemon website. The importance of design principles is emphasized, highlighting that while design is subjective, there are rules that can be followed to ensure enjoyable user experiences.

The video stresses the significance of functionality over aesthetics, using the analogy of serving fresh food with clean utensils to providing users with visually engaging and usable product designs. It introduces the idea that not everything beautiful is functional and vice versa, reinforcing the priority of functionality in design.

Three prominent design evaluation methodologies are discussed. Firstly, Dieter Rams' 10 Good Design Principles are introduced, highlighting their enduring appeal and influence on UX/UI design. Secondly, Jacob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design are presented, specifically relevant to human-computer interaction (HCI). Lastly, Ben Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design, also known as the Schneiderman evaluation, are introduced.

The video encourages designers to use these methodologies as aids to spot potential issues early in the design process, saving time, money, and ensuring the creation of more usable solutions. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating form flow against these principles and prioritizing improvements based on identified issues.

In summary, the video provides insights into popular evaluation methodologies by influential designers and underscores the importance of considering these principles during the ideation phase to enhance the overall user experience in design.

### **Evaluation Cheat Sheets**

### **Dieter Ram's 10 Principles of Good Design**

**Good design is innovative:** Whether you are making a change or doing something in a new way, developing new ideas or making improvements to existing designs and working alongside new technology, all of these offer a multitude of opportunities for you to be innovative within a design.

**Good design makes a product useful:** It doesn't matter how stunning a product looks if it is practically unusable as it becomes completely worthless. Products are not pieces of art to be admired. They are there to serve a purpose and solve a problem.

**Good design is aesthetic:** Beautiful items tend to make us feel comfortable. If a product is beautiful, you may be more inclined to use and want it. Some may argue against this point as you may have your own subjective idea of what is beautiful, and some well-designed items do prioritize utility over beauty. Regardless of your taste, you may like the things around you to be beautiful irrespective of how you define beauty.

**Good design makes a product understandable:** For example, handles on doors that don't indicate if they should be pushed or pulled or taps that don't indicate if they are hot or cold just leave the user confused. The opposite of this is an instantly understandable product that is completely self-explanatory and communicates what it's about, what it's for and how to use it. This saves a user from breaking the product or spending time reading through instruction manuals.

**Good design is unobtrusive:** An obtrusive product is an over-designed product. Products that tend to fail are those created with the designer in mind or with presumptions of who the user might be and or how they might use it. The very best products allow the user to do exactly what they want to do. These products should also help the user to complete their intended tasks effectively and happily. The design should not hinder the individual's intuitive process.

**Good design is honest:** Good design doesn't have tricks! It doesn't pretend to be something that it isn't, and it doesn't try to manipulate you into buying it by making promises that can't be kept. It should always have the user's best interests in mind, so it shouldn't have to try to lie to you or try to be something that it isn't.

**Good design is long-lasting:** Design should always be thorough to the last detail and avoids being fashionable which means that it never appears old or antiquated.

**Good design is thorough down to the last detail:** A Good design should be detail-oriented and leave nothing to chance. Every single aspect of the design should be considered, and all the elements should qualify to be a part of that design. Products should be designed with care, thoroughness, and concern for the intended user.

**Good design is environmentally friendly:** Pollution can arise from wasted resources throughout a product's lifespan. Design shouldn't be wasteful and should save resources where it can, both physically and digitally.

**Good design is as little as possible:** Design should always be intentional. Anything that doesn't serve a purpose for the user should be excluded. With less clutter, a design will achieve more clarity for the user.

**Visibility of system status:** Explore your smartphone. Right after the screen lights up, it informs you about its battery and if you have a Wi-Fi connection, any received messages, missed calls and much more. Imagine how insecure you would feel if this information were missing. The system communicates its status and assists users in making better, more informed decisions by using signs, icons and indicators.

**Match between the system and the real world:** Users may make assumptions about how a system will work based on their previous experiences with similar systems. You can help them overcome their initial discomfort by using language they are familiar with.

**User control and freedom:** Digital spaces, like physical spaces, require quick 'emergency exits'. Users frequently select system functions by accident and need a clearly marked way to leave the unwanted position without going through an extended dialogue. So, support the undo and redo functions.

**Consistency and standards:** Consistency is the key. A 'submit' button on one page should look the same across the site on any page. If you show information in a particular format on one page, it should look the same on all pages.

**Error prevention:** A careful design that prevents a problem from occurring in the first place is even better than good error messages. Remove conditions that may cause errors in your design, or look for them and give your users a confirmation option so that they can make an informed decision before tapping or selecting anything.

**Recognition rather than recall:** Allow your users to recognize information in the user interface rather than expecting them to remember or recall it. Simply put, don't make your users work any harder than necessary! Make your navigation as clear, detailed and straightforward as possible. Offer them hints, remind them when something time-sensitive needs to be done and notify them when a screen or a process has been changed.

**Flexibility and efficiency of use:** Simply put, your system must be designed so that both experienced and inexperienced users can use it. Think of designing a system where a new user can find a way to perform a task without knowing any shortcuts. However, also design your system in such a way that an experienced user can use shortcuts to complete the action quickly and efficiently.

**Aesthetic and minimalistic design:** Make a fantastic first impression! Users notice aesthetics or how visually appealing your system is in the first 50 milliseconds of landing on a page, which is ten times faster than it takes them to read it. This means that you should make sure that you establish and reinforce your system's brand identity and credibility.

**Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors:** A good error message should be polite, easy to understand, precise, constructive, clearly visible, and take as little time as possible to fix the problem as well as educate your users.

**Help and documentation:** Even though it is preferable that your system can be used without documentation. It is important that any such information should be: easy to find, focused on the user's task, include the actual steps they should take, and not be too large.

### Form Design

# Form design best practice

Companies use forms on their websites to allow visitors to sign up to create an account, buy a product, pay for an item and more. That is why online form design is so important. You may not be able to entice your visitors to take the time to provide you with all their personal information if you don't have a simple, user-friendly, visually or aesthetically pleasing form.

## What exactly is form design?

Form design is about creating a web form where your site visitors can enter and submit information while keeping the layout, format, user experience (UX), appearance and other factors in mind. A well-designed form improves the user experience and increases conversions, which means that you turn users into customers.

The design of your form influences your website's overall UX, affecting the number of happy visitors and conversions. A well-designed form demonstrates to users that your company is helpful, thoughtful, professional, technologically savvy and enjoyable to work with.

On the other hand, a poorly designed form may result in page and website abandonment or a frustrated user, resulting in a drop in conversions and sales. Expedia, for example, discovered that one extraneous form field box alone was costing them $12 million in profits per year! In this reading, you'll learn about some of the best practices and guidelines of form design.

## Form design best practices and guidelines

### Keep forms simple and straightforward

Avoid adding any unnecessary fields or questions. Include only the required information in your form.

### Use one column

When possible, use a single-column web form layout — this is especially important when creating long multi-step forms. Single-column layouts are more straightforward for visitors to follow, understand, complete and submit than forms with multiple columns.

### Clearly label your form

Give your form a title that lets your visitors know what will happen once they submit it. For example, a simple form title like 'create an account' clearly states that once a visitor submits their information, they will have created an account.

### Sort your form fields from the simplest to the most difficult

Begin your form with the most straightforward field questions (such as name and email) before moving on to the more time-consuming questions, for example, billing and shipping information. When visitors start filling out your form and think, 'OK, I can quickly add my name and email,' they are far less likely to leave the page since they have already decided to commit.

### Make use of inline form field validation

Inline form validation is a procedure that checks a visitor's information in real-time as they fill out the form. Suppose your visitors enter incorrect information into a field, such as an incorrect credit card number or email. An error message will show below or inside the form field, alerting the visitor to their mistake and allowing them to quickly correct it and move on to the next question.

### The text should be aligned to the left

Align all your text – including queries and labels - to the left side of the form so that it is easy for your visitors to read and complete. Researchers at the University of Basel observed that aligning text on the left side, above the form field box, decreases the time required to fill out the form. This alignment reduces the time a user's eyes have to move around, making the form easier to read.

### Do not request phone numbers

Unless collecting your visitors' phone numbers is critical, for example, a quote request or product demo, don't include it in your form. Asking for your visitors' phone numbers can create a feeling of suspicion unless they know a legitimate reason for the request. When possible, request an email address instead and use that to contact your visitors with their permission. Alternatively, make the phone number field in your form voluntary.

### Use browser auto-fill

Completing specific form fields is now quicker than ever, thanks to autofill features in browsers that draw from prior data entered from a visitor's device, like their first and last name. To help your visitors speed up the completion process, it's best practice to title each field with a word that browsers will recognize.

### Create mobile-friendly forms

Many people browse, purchase products and complete forms on their mobile devices, which is why mobile-friendly form design is critical. This helps visitors to your website to easily view a site on any mobile device and ensures that all the form information fits the screen size.

### Error messages should be positive

Make sure to sound positive when creating web form error messages. This is a great way to ensure that only correct information is submitted. Never blame the user; instead, use clear and concise language and include information that guides the visitor to the error. This way, they know precisely where it is and how it needs to be corrected.

### Include smart defaults

Enabling smart defaults is another excellent way to help speed up the form completion process while maintaining accuracy. Smart defaults use information like your user's current location to instantly enter details like city or town, saving them time.

### For long forms, add progress bars

Have you ever filled out a long form or survey and thought, "How many other questions are there?" Progress bars show how many questions your visitors must answer. They will give them a clue of how long it will take them to finish the task and may act as a form of motivation to finish the task at hand. These are especially helpful on long, multi-step forms.

### Use reCAPTCHAs rather than CAPTCHAs

Have you ever been asked to look at a relatively challenging image with numbers and letters and then to type those numbers and letters into a form field to confirm you're "not a robot" after completing a form? CAPTCHAs are used to identify SPAM and bots. They can, however, be time-consuming and frustrating to finish. They are still helpful; you may want to include this additional security measure in your forms.  If this is the case, you should use reCAPTCHAs in your forms instead. reCAPTCHAs identify fake accounts and bots not only successfully but also require that a visitor checks only a box before submitting a form. A CAPTCHA uses lettering for security whereas a ReCAPTCHA asks the user to identify elements of images.

### Allow users to navigate to the following form field by tab

There's no reason your form shouldn't support keyboard shortcuts, as there are many available. A good practice is to allow visitors to use the tab key on their keyboard to move to the following form field on your forms without having to take their hands off their keyboards.
