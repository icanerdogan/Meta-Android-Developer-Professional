## Designing Your UI

### **Design elements principles**

Though design can be fun and exciting, working with design elements and principles can be intricate and complicated. In this reading, you will explore design elements and principles to gain a deeper understanding of their usage.

## Lines

Lines are any linear marks, so if you think about it, lines include nearly everything. They even include the words and letters you are reading that consist of thousands of curved, angled and straight lines. Lines can also guide specific ideas. For example, straight lines can convey order and neatness, wavy lines can convey movement, and zig-zagged lines can convey tension or excitement. The use of 'leading lines is a common technique in photography. Finding and emphasizing strong leading lines in your piece can help direct the viewer's attention through the entire article or specific areas.

## Scale

Scale plays an important role in the design, sometimes literally. Scale is the deliberate sizing of individual elements in their most basic form. Scale can help you make sense of designs and images. However, the scale does not always have to be realistic. To create stunning effects and signal which parts of your design are more important and less important. You can size your elements dramatically, large or small.

## Color

Color is essential in design. Color creates moods, atmospheres and emotions. Each shade also has its own connotations. Color, in short, can make or break your design.

## Repetition

Think of any well-known brand. I'm sure you can all recall their logo, general tone of voice and general color schemes. Why are these things so memorable? You guessed it: repetition!

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/NeCsLT0gTbGgrC09IH2xBA_a6e7c6ca5f1d481687d613688a205da1_Reading-2.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=MdyV1YaFLkq3qcNpAbQl2DVr4-1H70hVACcU70dxhpE](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/NeCsLT0gTbGgrC09IH2xBA_a6e7c6ca5f1d481687d613688a205da1_Reading-2.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=MdyV1YaFLkq3qcNpAbQl2DVr4-1H70hVACcU70dxhpE)

When it comes to branding design, repetition is essential in keeping your branding consistent and tying your items together.

## Negative space

Negative space is the "space in between," or the area between or around other elements that form its own shape.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/EZFXkOp8QniRV5DqfGJ49Q_bb693da5dd574f489da5cb5efcd5b2a1_Picture8.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=NHmWjqdZzJno470Klp8paVRZ5Q2WAMCE7amxPAlBv0E](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/EZFXkOp8QniRV5DqfGJ49Q_bb693da5dd574f489da5cb5efcd5b2a1_Picture8.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=NHmWjqdZzJno470Klp8paVRZ5Q2WAMCE7amxPAlBv0E)

When used strategically and cleverly, negative space can help create truly stunning and clever designs.

## Symmetry

It has been scientifically proven that humans are drawn to symmetry. We find symmetrical faces, patterns and designs more appealing, effective and beautiful. Symmetry is not always an option for every design. Instead of attempting to achieve perfect symmetry, try to introduce subtle elements of symmetry into your design. Using symmetry, you can create a sense of balance and order in a layout.

## Transparency

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4Y3X17zYS1aN19e82HtWqA_07e45b286c9941e8b52ae57f30bedba1_Reading-3.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=EyK51_tKzD8OD2hkq6BWc9pjJKJOLOf-zyD_sRDZNO0](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4Y3X17zYS1aN19e82HtWqA_07e45b286c9941e8b52ae57f30bedba1_Reading-3.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=EyK51_tKzD8OD2hkq6BWc9pjJKJOLOf-zyD_sRDZNO0)

Transparency, also known as "opacity," refers to how" see-through" an element is. The lower the opacity, the lighter and less noticeable the element, and the higher the opacity, the more solid the element.

## Texture

Texture can add tactility, depth and cool effects to your design.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vhipBrXaQQuYqQa12gEL4g_fc00e86120a44af0a65c0b054ca77fa1_Reading-4.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=nqWnXKmal6MrDbAVU3c-ULIML3c10NACR4aWUd2TfKg](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/vhipBrXaQQuYqQa12gEL4g_fc00e86120a44af0a65c0b054ca77fa1_Reading-4.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=nqWnXKmal6MrDbAVU3c-ULIML3c10NACR4aWUd2TfKg)

You can create a distinctive piece for your design that will stand out from the crowd by considering texture and how your design literally and tangibly feels.

## Balance

Balance ensures that no element overpowers another.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7rPhjPW4Tz-z4Yz1uE8_WQ_d6e2cfc34b7d4938869f81881cbab0a1_Picture7.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=6cf2tvZjLAmeIFQ6wjSHZk9Rx4-iGw70X69aWhi2BAI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7rPhjPW4Tz-z4Yz1uE8_WQ_d6e2cfc34b7d4938869f81881cbab0a1_Picture7.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=6cf2tvZjLAmeIFQ6wjSHZk9Rx4-iGw70X69aWhi2BAI)

One technique for mastering balance is to imagine each element as having a 'weight' behind it. Consider each element's size, shape and 'weight' in relation to other elements on the page, from text boxes, to images, to color blocks.

## Hierarchy

The most important things on your page are headings and titles. These are at the top of a hierarchical scale, and they command the most attention. Next, we have sub-headings, pull quotes, and additional information. A pull quote is a small section of text extracted from an article or book and quoted in a different format. Make sure these are eye-catching and noticeable but not as prominent as your headings. Elements of your design that are given the least amount of visual charm are things like body copy, less important information, links and so on. Hierarchy does not stop with type. Images have a hierarchy as well. The elements of your image that are larger, more colorful or more central will have a higher hierarchy than those that are smaller, duller or less detailed.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/bK0PYOCsRMytD2DgrGTMFQ_fd8ac5fbeaf744cba52f747b9472bda1_Picture9.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=9XhvNgAbaAVCepYdscfNM7OZSu6_qUXSk5uOV3o4koI](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/bK0PYOCsRMytD2DgrGTMFQ_fd8ac5fbeaf744cba52f747b9472bda1_Picture9.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=9XhvNgAbaAVCepYdscfNM7OZSu6_qUXSk5uOV3o4koI)

## Contrast

Contrast is frequently the magical, key ingredient in making your designs "pop" or stand out.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/k7rmzR2lTKa65s0dpaymKg_6f798361729248449e08b9fa143c40a1_Picture-7.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=0PpBqc1PXj8MM7m3FKrEPUZ0svPpY6MlKepBArutfhw](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/k7rmzR2lTKa65s0dpaymKg_6f798361729248449e08b9fa143c40a1_Picture-7.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=0PpBqc1PXj8MM7m3FKrEPUZ0svPpY6MlKepBArutfhw)

Contrast, in its most basic form, is the degree of difference between two elements of your design. Dark versus light, thick versus thin, large versus small and so on are all examples of contrast. Contrast has a significant impact on readability and legibility. Contrast is more than just a stylistic element or a legibility enhancer; it can also be used to draw attention to specific elements of your design. Designers use this technique often in website design. So, use contrast to make your designs visually 'pop" or stand out, drawing attention to specific design elements such as "call-to-action" buttons, which are instructions given to the visitor to entice them to take action. A "call-to-action" button could be as simple as "call us now," "find out more," or "subscribe to our newsletter."

## Frame

Correctly framing your designs is just as important as framing your photographs and works of art. Think of framing in terms of photography - what you include, exclude and so on. However, framing is just as necessary in design.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/58Oznj0DSuyDs549AyrsAw_6466b5a9fdc647a9b5c88e1e8555b5a1_Picture-8.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=9H-bqHHcp4C2TEPpR3hBJSmbZMdxBLpkw0PaOhLNwZo](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/58Oznj0DSuyDs549AyrsAw_6466b5a9fdc647a9b5c88e1e8555b5a1_Picture-8.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=9H-bqHHcp4C2TEPpR3hBJSmbZMdxBLpkw0PaOhLNwZo)

You can use box outlines or graphic elements to enhance or draw attention to specific elements of your design. The frame draws attention to the piece and directs the eye to the essential parts.

## Grid

Think of a design grid to be the foundation of a house; it is a necessary first step in allowing you to build a functional and beautiful final product. It indicates to the builder or designer where certain elements should be placed, what should align with what and also provides a general outline.

Grids are important but often unseen components of almost any design. They are made up of a set number of rows and columns against which you can align your elements. Grids can help you keep your content organized, neat, legible and visually appealing. So, start with a grid that works for you and your design and work your way up from there.

## Direction

The direction and movement of the eye across the page are important aspects of many designs; this is also referred to as "flow." How do your eyes cross the page? Do your readers know what to look for next? Is the path their eyes take logical?

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cwnK5Yo7QXyJyuWKO8F8vQ_0a37c949093b463db330bcb9f8eb1ca1_Picture-9.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=myeMcxIJ3QaO36Is5xunL4olumyNtWrawsxCaVPrltU](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cwnK5Yo7QXyJyuWKO8F8vQ_0a37c949093b463db330bcb9f8eb1ca1_Picture-9.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=myeMcxIJ3QaO36Is5xunL4olumyNtWrawsxCaVPrltU)

Several studies have been conducted to determine the precise nature of our eye movement habits and the patterns our eyes trace when viewing specific objects. Click the link below to explore the Nielsen Norman Group eye-tracking study, which tracked people's eyes while viewing web pages to determine their use patterns.

[https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered/)

According to the research, a common pattern for the eye to follow is an "E" or "F." So, placing your top content to the left or along the top is perhaps the best way. A "Z" shape is another common pattern that the eye follows.

The general idea is that the eye naturally travels in a "sweeping" motion from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. This theory is best explained in depth by The Gutenberg Diagram. Click the link below to read this theory in detail.

[https://3.7designs.co/blog/2009/01/03/the-gutenburg-diagram-in-design/](https://3.7designs.co/blog/2009/01/03/the-gutenburg-diagram-in-design/)

Rather than designing entirely around these patterns, try to adapt the flow and direction of your designs on a case-by-case basis. Just keep in mind that the eye is drawn to the top left corner of the page and works its way down.

## Rules

This is a topic that is sure to spark heated debate and divide any room of designers, with one half proclaiming that there are no rules in design and the other claiming that there are many. Technically, they're both correct. As with any skill, there are things to learn, and these come with general guidelines. Make sure your type is legible, learn to kern (adjust the spacing between individual letters or characters), avoid using pixelated images and so on. These are the design foundations, the elements that help you create a basic design. However, as many argue, once you've learned these rules, it's time to break them. Both following and breaking the rules have their place in the world of design.

## Depth

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/AbVocVs8RWS1aHFbPJVkLw_4a11bede8c7d4a5fb4de9fce891705a1_Picture-10.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=gX71d6oqCe8XpqwQVK6KIlhl0ifgEo46Ve0YkOupbEg](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/AbVocVs8RWS1aHFbPJVkLw_4a11bede8c7d4a5fb4de9fce891705a1_Picture-10.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=gX71d6oqCe8XpqwQVK6KIlhl0ifgEo46Ve0YkOupbEg)

In the world of design, depth is an essential and exciting principle. You can create a sense of depth and the illusion that your design extends beyond the second dimension, even with the flattest of mediums. There are numerous techniques for communicating depth in your design; let's go over a few. First, there are shadows, which are probably the most well-known technique. Shadows are tricky because they aren't always linearly shaped, as they can stretch, bend, warp and skew. So, observing real-world shadows and seeing how the light hits various objects at different points is a good technique for exploring shadow usage.

Overlapping certain elements is another technique. This reduces the flat appearance of the design and makes it appear more layered, with different levels and tiers. Another technique is to experiment with perspective, which often gives elements a "3-dimensional or 3D effect". You can give the illusion of raising certain elements off the page by adjusting their perspective, creating instant depth. On the other end of the spectrum, you can reduce the amount of depth in your design. This is a recent popular style, also known as 'flat design.'

## Composition

Composition is an excellent place to end because it connects all the other principles discussed earlier on.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/TLs5RMQ7Sba7OUTEO8m25g_fa1d0328bf3f4b43b7406c1585bb7da1_Picture-11.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=rgLrcPGjjDwHds-ZP4FKx6y6Q_L7KyXzdkdJ34K2KrY](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/TLs5RMQ7Sba7OUTEO8m25g_fa1d0328bf3f4b43b7406c1585bb7da1_Picture-11.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=rgLrcPGjjDwHds-ZP4FKx6y6Q_L7KyXzdkdJ34K2KrY)

"Composition" refers to the overall arrangement of elements in your design, which sounds a little boring when explained that way, but it's one of the more enjoyable aspects of design. This is where you can experiment and make a good design look even better.

### **Design systems**

Design systems are constantly changing collections of reusable components, principles and guidelines that provide designers and developers with a common language for consistent product and web design. A Design System is a set of deliverables that evolve alongside the product, tools and technological advances. It contains both tangible and intangible elements like patterns, components, guidelines, and other designer and developer tools.

Additionally, they contain some abstract elements, such as brand values, shared ways of working, mindsets and shared beliefs. So, there are really two parts that are Reusable Elements and Shared Values.

## Reusable elements

Reusable elements are advice on how to apply the elements together, which is the why and how. The image below shows what is involved in creating a design system.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/RPdUztQVRcy3VM7UFbXMbQ_6b4d0fe713924017a4387551b4359aa1_UX_UI_Design-sketch.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=w7lJq0qF6UP01BhFfOKkVZsfk891T-ZkV1A81I6NLJs](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/RPdUztQVRcy3VM7UFbXMbQ_6b4d0fe713924017a4387551b4359aa1_UX_UI_Design-sketch.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=w7lJq0qF6UP01BhFfOKkVZsfk891T-ZkV1A81I6NLJs)

### What do design systems contain?

The primary goal of a design system is to make the work of design teams easier. So, the first question is not "What should I include in my Design System?" But rather, "Who will use it and how?" Once a goal has been defined and an idea of what's already in place in the company and questions like:

- What works and what doesn't?
- What is the teams' experience on this subject?
- What are the existing tools?

have been addressed and answered, it will be clearer where to start compiling the design system.

## Shared values

Aligning design teams around a standard set of goals is critical. It will help to create a vision and may ensure that everyone looks in the same direction. These objectives will change over time, which is natural. So, changes to the design system need to be widely communicated. In terms of values, they are great ideals that will guide choices in accordance with the brand objectives. Ensure that designs do not deviate from the fundamental values. Aside from these brand and product values, you should also define team values that help to unite each team member, which includes designers, developers and stakeholders, with a common mindset. These shared values may contain the following:

### Design principles

Design principles are guiding sentences that assist teams in achieving the goal of the product through design. While design principles are not the most common design system component, they should be considered. A set of meaningful design principles lays a better foundation and guides the team through the creation and ongoing implementation of a design system.

An example of this is Google material design's approach to design principles. It is minimalistic and focuses on what distinguishes Material Design as a universal design system. Their guiding principles are:

- Material is the metaphor.
- It is bold, graphic, and intentional.
- Motion provides meaning.

### Brand identity and language

The visible elements of a brand, such as color, design and logo, that identify and distinguish the brand in the minds of consumers are referred to as brand identity. These brand elements require some rules, which will serve as the system's grammar and unification, for example, do's and don'ts and "good examples" of product use as displayed in the image below:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gmxxgehbTpyscYHoW06cfA_18d055645db9434cb1dc5d74ec73a1a1_brand-identity.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=3_yBSC_xr2DfGPuIpSZu3zmWD3X5lDaAqWtjXLAZhHs](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/gmxxgehbTpyscYHoW06cfA_18d055645db9434cb1dc5d74ec73a1a1_brand-identity.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=3_yBSC_xr2DfGPuIpSZu3zmWD3X5lDaAqWtjXLAZhHs)

This will ensure that the design teams use the "right combinations" of this language, which is what makes the brand so distinct and recognizable. Think of some popular brands and what makes them so distinct and recognizable.

### Components and patterns

The design system is built around components and patterns. Patterns are the building instructions that allow you to use these components logically and consistently across all products. A component, on the other hand, contains technical and functional documentation, and a pattern will provide recommendations on how to use it. All the previously mentioned elements will assist in developing them and help to deliver a consistent experience. The components are like blocks. As a designer, you can use these in layouts, and you can also use them directly in code. How they function and how a user interacts with them should be defined. Patterns are the building instructions that allow us to use these components logically and consistently across all products.

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/N7QK6bP2SSi0Cumz9tko1Q_04e35a751cd2450a9035d1cb109708a1_Component.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=bHGM-1GHSNOsxnljhcSRsIezx5J9HxICru276BvkRHs](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/N7QK6bP2SSi0Cumz9tko1Q_04e35a751cd2450a9035d1cb109708a1_Component.png?expiry=1701648000000&hmac=bHGM-1GHSNOsxnljhcSRsIezx5J9HxICru276BvkRHs)

A component is specified with technical and functional documentation, whereas a pattern will provide recommendations on how to use it.

## Final thoughts on design systems

Design systems are composed of various components like patterns, styles, and guidelines that can assist in operationalizing and optimizing designs. They are, however, designed, managed and implemented by people. The scale and reproduction of projects and the resources and time available are the most important factors to consider when developing a design system. When design systems are poorly implemented and maintained, they can become unwieldy collections of components and code; however, when implemented correctly, they can educate team members, streamline work, and enable designers to tackle complex UX problems.
